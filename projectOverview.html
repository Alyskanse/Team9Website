    <p class="mainStyle">By 2019, the global average temperature raised by 0.50c.
        In the next 50 years, the temperature in the arctic region will rise from 4C to 7C.
        Among them, the temperature changes in the arctic regions will be the most significant.
        In the past 50 years, the arctic temperatures rose from 3 ℃ to 4 ℃.
        There are many factors contributing to global warming that scientists are still unable to fully explain.
        I have been waiting for someone to pick up this bottle more than 50 years,
        and right now, it is your time to save the world.
        You are about to embark on a game that could change the fate of the world.
        Be careful because the choices you make will affect the state of the world in the future.
