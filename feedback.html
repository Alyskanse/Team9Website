        Summary of Feedback we received
    </h3>

    <p class="mainStyle">
        Overall everyone understood that our artifact was a game where someone from the future tries
        to save the world from climate change. It was also understood that the physical aspect of our
        artifact was a glass bottle with water that represented the last melted ice from Earth.
        Some people seemed to be confused on how the puzzle pieces and twine part would work,
        so we will edit our website to make that more clear.

        For the interactive part of our project, the most mentioned thing was the digital aspect.
        People wondered about the QR code part, what is the other digital interaction.
        Other questions were about how the game works. Some suggestions of possible investigations
        that we received were that we should look at some choose your own adventure books for inspiration.
        Secondly, one of our responses recommended that we add a QR code or more digital aspects to our book.
        To address this, we are still working on our twine game, that will be part of the digital part and
        we are going to try and make it act like a choose your own adventure book. There was also one very
        interesting suggestion that we should research if the bottle would last 50 years in the ocean due
        to pressure and different temperature.

        As far as our website goes, most people thought that the background color, which is dark grey,
        was too dark and hard to look at. While the website is very functional, it is too simple and has
        no decorations, since it is made from scratch. To make the website look more interesting,
        we will put some decorations on, such as a cover page, colorful pictures for the background
        and a navigation bar. We have resources from Juhyun as well, which is to watch some videos to
        get a better idea of how to structure the website.

        What We Plan to Change
    </h3>

    <p class="mainStyle">
        To help readers understand better, we will add more detail on our backstory.
        We are going to make our artifact more reasonable for the readers/players from the “new trigger”.
        The new idea for our backstory is as follows: Let’s assume that the readers(players) are part of a
        climate research team. The glass jar is considered as the start of the journey of our artifact.
        Once he/she opens up the glass jar that the research team found, they are time traveled to where the weather
        and environment was normal. They will make choices that will affect future environments in a question-answer
        form, and based on their answers, they will have a chance to make a better future.
    </p>

        For our interactive part, we have discussed many ideas but are still deciding.
        We’ve got many ideas such as making a few different endings, pictures for puzzle pieces,
        and making connections interactively between the physical and digital part.
        Since we did not have enough time to discuss further, we have decided to meet tomorrow to work on our project.
    </p>

    <p class="mainStyle">
        For the website, we are going to change the dark background to a brighter color,
        add more pictures, work on the formatting and borders, add a navigation bar, change the font,
        and in general make it look better.
