        A Description of our Artifact
    </h3>

    <p class="prototypeAbout">
      The idea behind our artifact is that in the next 50 years, climate change will get much worse. This
        will lead to all the ice melting from the arctic regions, based on the fact that temperatures
        have already been rising there a lot in our current world. We had the idea at first to make a
        game where the player had to answer questions about climate change and make choices about
        what to do in order to help the world. We decided that these questions would be placed in a class
        jar or bottle with water in it. The water represents the last melted ice from Earth. At the start of the
        game the player reads instructions about how to play. In those instructions is A a QR code that will lead
        them to a digital twine game. Once they pick their answer to each question on the paper, they will
        go to the twine game and it will explain to them why that was a good or bad answer. Also after they pick
        an answer they will get a puzzle piece from the bottle. Once they have finished answering all the
        questions and collecting all the puzzle pieces, the puzzle will create a code that they will enter
        into the twine game and it will give the player a story of what happens to the world based on the
        answers that they chose.

        Backstory
    </h3>

    <p class="prototypeAbout">
        By 2019, the global average temperature raised by 0.50c. In the next 50 years,
        the temperature in the arctic region will rise by 4C to 7C. Among them, the temperature
        changes in the arctic regions will be the most significant. In the past 50 years, the arctic
        temperatures rose from 3 ℃ to 4 ℃. There are many factors contributing to global warming that
        scientists are still unable to fully explain.
        But now there is hope for the world since you have picked up this bottle. It is your time to save
        the world. You are about to embark on a game that could change the fate of the world for the better,
        or worse. You will be asked questions and depending on your answers, something will change.
        Be careful because the choices you make will affect the state of the world in the future.

        How We Made It
    </h3>

    <h4 class="prototypeIntro">
        The Physical Artifact
    </h4>

    <p class="prototypeAbout">
        For the physical part of our artifact we found a jar to put the water in (the last melted ice)
        and put our printed out questions in with the corresponding puzzle pieces. In the jar we also
        have our instructions page, which tells the player how to play the game and gives them
        the QR code to the twine game.
    </p>

    <h4 class="prototypeIntro">
        The Digital Portion
    </h4>

    <p class="prototypeAbout">
        For the digital part of our artifact we made a twine game that the player goes through while answering
        the questions. The player will read the questions from the jar, then go to the twine game to pick
        their answer. Once they click A or B for their answer it leads them to a page that tells them
        if that was a good or bad answer.
