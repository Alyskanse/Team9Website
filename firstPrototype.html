        A Description of our Artifact
    </h3>

    <p class="prototypeAbout">
      The idea behind our artifact is that in the next 50 years, climate change will get much worse. This
        will lead to all the ice melting from the arctic regions, based on the fact that temperatures
        have already been rising there a lot in our current world. We had the idea at first to make a
        game where the player had to answer questions about climate change and make choices about
        what to do in order to help the world. We decided that these questions would be placed in a class
        jar or bottle with water in it. The water represents the last melted ice from Earth. At the start of the
        game the player reads instructions about how to play. In those instructions is A a QR code that will lead
        them to a digital twine game. Once they pick their answer to each question on the paper, they will
        go to the twine game and it will explain to them why that was a good or bad answer. Also after they pick
        an answer they will get a puzzle piece from the bottle. Once they have finished answering all the
        questions and collecting all the puzzle pieces, the puzzle will create a code that they will enter
        into the twine game and it will give the player a story of what happens to the world based on the
        answers that they chose.

        Backstory
    </h3>

    <p class="prototypeAbout">
        By 2019, the global average temperature raised by 0.50c. In the next 50 years,
        the temperature in the arctic region will rise by 4C to 7C. Among them, the temperature
        changes in the arctic regions will be the most significant. In the past 50 years, the arctic
        temperatures rose from 3 ℃ to 4 ℃. There are many factors contributing to global warming that
        scientists are still unable to fully explain.
    </p>

    <p class="prototypeAbout">
        Now in 2078, because of  global warming, the earth's temperature is accelerating, and we don’t have
        four seasons anymore,  only hot weather. The younger generations have never seen natural ice and snow.
        Because of the rising temperatures, there is less and less water on the earth. A climate research team
        found samples from scientists 58 years ago, and that is the melted ice that is left in this bottle that you
        are holding.
    <p/>

    <p class="prototypeAbout">
        But now there is hope for the world since you have picked up this bottle. It is your time to save
        the world. You are about to embark on a game that could change the fate of the world for the better,
        or worse. You will be asked questions and depending on your answers, something will change.
        Be careful because the choices you make will affect the state of the world in the future.

        The Physical Artifact
    </h4>

    <p class="prototypeAbout">
        For the physical part of our artifact we found a jar to put the water in (the last melted ice)
        and put our printed out questions in with the corresponding puzzle pieces. In the jar we also
        have our instructions page, which tells the player how to play the game and gives them
        the QR code to the twine game.

        The Digital Portion
    </h4>

    <p class="prototypeAbout">
        For the digital part of our artifact we made a twine game that the player goes through while answering
        the questions. The player will read the questions from the jar, then go to the twine game to pick
        their answer. Once they click A or B for their answer it leads them to a page that tells them
        if that was a good or bad answer.

        During the progress of creating our group project together, I mostly worked on writing the questions
        that go along with our digital part, which is the website. I also did research to find resources
        for information that we needed for our questions. For example, I looked up some research on
        facts of global warming, including causes and solutions for that. Resources that I found were helpful,
        and research successful affected the way we are creating things. Based on the information of earth’s
        current environmental state that we brought from the research, we will give reasons to our answers of
        questions so that our project is actually relatable to climate issues. While our non-digital part and
        digital part are interacting with each other, I think putting real facts to our questions instead of
        filling our project with our imaginations of future will result out in better completion. Talking about
        the issues during project that we faced and had to fix or overcome, we had to dump our first idea on how
        our artifact is going to look like because of disconnection between our artifact design and theme of the
        project. It was especially hard for me to do so because I really liked this idea. Also, snow storm was a
        big difficulty for us to communicate over the past few weeks, but I think we are going through it well.

        My role so far has been to make the website and the digital component of our artifact (the twine game).
        I also wrote the description of our artifact for the prototype write up, made the flowchart, and described
        how we made the physical/ digital components. I think it is going well so far, but the campus closures
        made it so we could not meet at all, and two group members lost power so it was a little difficult to
        communicate.

    <p class="prototypeAbout">
        For this group project, I took the role to come up with the main idea and also the back story.
        As you can noticed from our website, we had completely changed our artifact but the idea of the whole
        story remain the same. I came up with this change because the professor said he would like to see
        our physical object more related to the main idea. For our last artifact idea, it would have taken a hard time
        to make and it was not towards our topic like the new idea which is we are using right now. The new idea also helped
        me to come up with the back story and also the situation after 50 years. At the beginning, I had a hard
        time to think about the condition after 50 years but since I came up with the new idea, it refreshed my mind.
        Since we haven’t meet in person for the past two weeks and also having the bad weather, the progress for
        our project went slow as we plan but everything still on schedule. If we will have the normal meeting in
        the later, I think communication would not be a problem then.

        My role so far was to come up with the questions we were going to use for our prototype.
        I was also in charge of making the prototype in the image above (glass jar). I think we haven’t
        really had any problems with designing or making the artifact so far. However, I agree with Alyshia
        that the campus closure and snow made it very difficult for us to communicate and work as a group
        in the last 2 weeks.
