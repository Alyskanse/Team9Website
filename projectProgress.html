    <p class="picture-description">In our first sketch, we wanted to create a book that had questions on each page
        and after the reader picked answer A or B, they would collect their piece </p>

    <p class="picture-description">In our second sketch, we decided on what kind of book we wanted to make
    and drew a more detailed picture of how we would set up the questions and the pockets that would
    hold the puzzle pieces.</p>

    <div class="pictures">
        <figure class="picture-item">
            <img class="thumbnail"
                 src="secondSketch.png" width="300" height="300">
        </figure>
    </div>

    <p class="picture-description">In our third sketch, we completely changed our idea of what we wanted our
    artifact to be. Instead of making a book,, which had no connection to our theme, we decided to have a
    glass jar with water that represented the last melted ice from Earth and plastic bags of the questions
    and puzzle pieces.</p>
