        <p class="group-introductions">
            I am currently a Freshman, thinking about majoring in Interactive media design.
            I was born and raised in Korea, and moved to America 3 years ago.
            I like playing a high level of tennis and video games.
            Evidence for that, I won 2 tennis tournaments and played varsity tennis in high school, and
            reached to diamond in league which is top 0.5 percent. During  our group project,
            I took a specific role of listening to others and helping to combine ideas together to apply them
            to our project.

            I am currently a senior, major in media & communication. I am better at communication part more
            than the media part. I don't like playing video games but I like generating new ideas.
            I took the role in our group of using my ideas and experience to guide our group
            members to complete our group project.
