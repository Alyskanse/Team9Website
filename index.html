        <p>
            As global warming accelerates, the average temperature rise on the Earth's surface
            is getting faster and faster. From 1880 to 2019, the average global temperature has
            risen by only 0.8 Celsius, but it starts to rise much faster from 2020 due to some
            factors that can not be explained scientifically. Scientists declared a state of
            emergency claiming we will go extinct in 100 years if the global temperature rise persists.
            This unexplainable phenomenon is specifically significant in the Arctic regions,
            so large-scale research teams are set up to solve these unknown phenomena and sent
            to the Arctic region.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now in 2519, with the efforts of many people, rapid warming has been slowed down considerably.
            Humans are still alive even 500 years after the declaration was published, but people are
            suffering because of the already enormous temperature. Earth does not have four seasons anymore,
            and there is only hot weather. The younger generations have never seen natural ice and snow.
            Also, our population has enormously decreased since most of the inhabitable areas are submerged
            by increased sea level with melted ice from the arctic regions. To avoid burning at too high a
            temperature and not to be addicted to pollutants in the air, everyone wraps their bodies in clothes
            and masks when they go out.
        </p>

        <p>
            While people are suffering in such pain, the research in arctic regions is still ongoing.
            You are the head team leader of a research team from America. This evening, you are scheduled
            to do an examination and inspection on a sample that your team discovered. It is melted ice
            in a glass jar, left by scientists 50 years after the start of the rapid warming. You and your
            team are speculating that this sample could be a crucial hint to figure out the causes of
            unexplainable climate change.
        </p>

        <p>
            As soon as you open the glass jar, you are traveled back to the year 2019, where the weather
            and environment are quite normal but still potentially dangerous. You are about to embark on a
            game that could save the fate of humanity. You will be asked questions, and something in the
            future will change depending on your answers. Be very responsible and considerable, because the
            choices you make will affect the state of the world in the future. Good luck.
